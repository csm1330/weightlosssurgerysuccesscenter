Firstly, an overview of current understanding of what constitute a stressor and how this can affect an individual is presented from sport and exercise psychology literature. Secondly, a model of coping styles is illustrated with the aim to shed light at how different perceptions of levels of stress and anxiety are managed both on an individual and group level. Thirdly, within the context of this understanding, some examples about how to support individuals on the ASC will be illustrated. Finally, implications for future research and reflection will be presented by highlighting the importance of teaching and learning coping and tolerance skills as part of a comprehensive and holistic psycho-educational program.

         <p class="first" id="d2e129">The present paper will illustrate current knowledge drawn from sport and performance
            literature in order to clarify how stressors and perceived level of stress experienced
            are related to each other. A better understanding of these constructs will hopefully
            lead to a clearer analysis of the mechanisms around coping responses and coping styles
            adopted by individuals with ASCs. The objective will be to mark down ways through
            which resources, support and adaptive changes could assist how stress and anxiety
            could be dealt with, so optimal performance can be achieved. In some sport and performance
            literature, stressors have been defined as <i>environmental demands encountered by an individual</i> and have been categorized into three main groups; competitive, organizational and
            personal stressors (<a href="#r3">Fletcher, Hanton, &amp; Mellalieu, 2006</a>). These three different groups are explained as follows.

            <p class="first" id="d2e140">Competitive stressors are defined as “<i>an ongoing transaction between an individual and the environmental demands associated
                  primarily and directly with competitive performance”</i> (<a href="#r3">Fletcher et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, only stressors directly related to competitive performance are named
               as competitive stressors (for example an opponent strength and qualities in a specific
               race) (<a href="#r7">Hanton &amp; Fletcher, 2005</a>). Some other examples include:

            <p id="d2e164">When we consider competitive stressors within the environment for an individual with
               ASC, it indicates we draw some clear parallels where stressors stemming from the demands
               placed on the individual with ASC in any environmental account referring to the quality
               of their performance. Following a simple sequence and/or an adult instruction, that
               may cause anxiety when the environment is too crowded, noisy or when there is a limited
               time when the task needs to be completed. Pressure to perform it correctly and efficiently
               – fear of failure - pressure stemming from having to select relevant information (and
               skills) for the task, as well as ensuring that all skills necessary – competition
               techniques – are not only being acquired, but also retrieved at the right moment and
               eventually mastered. During these times individuals decide to place a significant
               amount of pressure, and it is important to recognize that potentially undue anxiety
               on behalf of the individual needs to be better managed and controlled.

            <p id="d2e195">Understanding organizational stressors within a sporting environment is thought to
               be significant due to its conflicting nature towards athletic performance and optimal
               outcomes. Furthermore, contemporary evidence proposes that organizational stressors
               currently have the most significant influence upon athletic performance (<a href="#r4">Fletcher et al., 2012</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d2e200">When translating these types of stressors within organizational environments where
               individuals on the ASCs have often little control and/or choice over, we can again
               illustrate how organizational structures, and at times restrictions, can lead to increased
               levels of anxiety. Factors can include choices on how they travel and with whom, the
               type of accommodation and/or provision they access, their role within the organization
               or provision, their social support system (or lack of), their role insecurity, where
               they are going and aiming in terms of personal aspirations, development and interests.
               Although empirical evidence in this area is scarce, from professional experience organizational
               stressors would certainly amount to a significant level of influence and can consequently
               be considered a potential source of stress upon individuals with ASC, which is often
               underestimated or at times disregarded altogether. Organizational stressors look very
               much at the demands of the environment where the individual performs and the dynamics
               within it. It demonstrates that the physical environment and social environment –
               people acting, performing within – have significant influence on the performance outcomes
               of the individual with ASCs.

            <p class="first" id="d2e205">The third classification, personal stressors, is defined as <i>“an ongoing transaction between an individual and the environmental demands associated
                  primarily and directly with personal life events”</i>. Examples can include lifestyle issues and financial issues (<a href="#r15">Thelwell et al., 2007</a>). Psychological stress reveals a particular relationship between a person and the
               environment, the way the latter is appraised by the individual as taxing or exceeding
               one’s own resources as well as endangering one’s own well-being (<a href="#r11">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</a>). From a theoretical perspective, <a href="#r11">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</a> created this transactional model of stress and coping helping to understand the stress
               appraisal and coping relationship as a process which is fluid and changeable (see
               <a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>).

            <p id="d2e232"><a href="#r6">Folkman, Lazarus, Pimley, and Novacek (1987)</a> suggested two central processes which determine the outcome of a stressful experience
               in a given situation: a cognitive and a coping process (see <a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>). The first includes three basic forms of appraisal: a <i>primary appraisal</i> where the individual assesses the significance of the situation and gauges whether
               the situation is positive, stressful or irrelevant. A <i>secondary appraisal</i>, which is an assessment of coping resources and options available depending on the
               situation appraised (e.g. threat, challenge or loss). The third is the notion of <i>reappraisal</i>, which is a state of being ‘on guard’ as processes are in constant motion due to
               possible changes in the environment and developing coping skills. Emotional reactions
               need to be mastered and this is when cognitive appraisals leave the stage to different
               forms of coping processes.
            </p>
            <p id="d2e248">The model asserts that individuals’ cognitive appraisals of potentially stressful
               situations will be influenced by an interaction between the person (e.g., goals) and
               the situation (e.g., social interactions, the environment) factors. The transactional
               model provides a conceptual framework which addresses that stress, rather than a quantifiable
               and determined entity, needs to be seen as a fluid process which encompasses the overall
               processes including stressors – the source of the problem issue - appraisals – the
               way people perceive the issue-strain and coping – the way individuals resolve (or
               try to resolve), rather than trying to explain it as a single phenomena (<a href="#r8">Hanton, Fletcher, &amp; Coughlan, 2005</a>). Furthermore, there are changes in our capacity to assess and process stressors
               as follows.

            <p id="d2e263">Physiologically, hormones play a significant part in coping management. The stress
               hormone cortisol was found to be elevated in males during stressful situations although
               less so for females. Automatic responses also known as the fight-or-flight responses
               activate the sympathetic nervous system in the form of an increased focus levels,
               increased adrenaline production, and epinephrine. When facing threats these responses
               are activated for survival. These responses are experienced by every one of us with
               different level of intensity, duration and range, but nonetheless all of us will experience
               physiological changes. Differences are also felt by the individual perception of the
               stressor in question and availability and access to personal resources.

            <p id="d2e265">For individuals with ASCs this level of anxiety and stress is usually elevated, which
               makes the process of cognitive appraisal and reappraisal even more taxing. Perceptual
               narrowing is experienced by difficulties in coordinating movements, seeing and processing
               perceptual depth (<a href="#r13">Rodgers, 2000</a>), selecting relevant information for decision making purposes. The ability to self-regulate
               and recognize signs of stress is also often challenged because of their autism and
               the challenges associated with their ability to recognize emotional changes in themselves
               and others.

         <p class="first" id="d2e275">Coping refers to the individual response to a psychological stressor which is often
            related to a negative event. However, as illustrated earlier on, stressors can be
            classified into different areas which do not necessarily amount exclusively to negative
            events: preparing to go on a trip to the seaside can pose a challenge and potentially
            raise levels of anxiety and stress in an individual with ASC, despite being considered
            by most an enjoyable activity. It is therefore the <i>perception</i> of stress levels associated with a specific event/task/activity that will determine
            how an individual is affected and ultimately how they cope.
         </p>
         <p id="d2e280">People may adopt a range of coping styles though <a href="#r11">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</a> have identified two broad categories: problem-focus coping styles and emotion-focus
            coping styles. People using problem-focus coping styles aim to deal with the source
            of the problem often tackling and changing it. This can be achieved through finding
            out more information on the issue and learning new skills to manage it. Problem-focus
            coping is aimed at changing or eliminating the source of the stress. <a href="#r5">Folkman and Lazarus (1988)</a> have also identified a further three types within this category: taking control,
            information seeking, and evaluating negatives and positives within a given situation.
         </p>
         <p id="d2e288">Emotion-focus coping styles instead are aimed towards managing the emotional responses
            to the <i>perception</i> of a stressful event/situation. Emotion-focus coping styles aim to reduce, alleviate
            and/or minimise the unpleasant, stressful feeling associated with the stressor. The
            focus of this coping style is to guide away, accept and/or manage the emotional responses
            to an unchangeable and/or uncontrollable situation. It is also important to distinguish
            between an avoidance coping mechanism related to the emotional response coping style
            and a positive re-appraisal; the latter preferable as a long term emotion-focus coping
            style mechanism. Distancing or avoiding a situation over an extended period of time
            can become detrimental to the individual.
         </p>
         <p id="d2e293">A third classification proposed by <a href="#r2">Carver and Connor-Smith (2010)</a> is identified as the appraisal-focus coping style which aims at challenging the assumption
            of an individual’s perception of a specific stressor through a cognitive re-evaluation.
            Our thinking gets challenged and through reappraisal gets re-constructed in a more
            positive frame. This process is often used in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
            (<a href="#r1">Beck, 1979</a>). People tend to use a variety of coping styles, according to the stressor and context.
            However, what seems to be happening in situations when the issue and source of stress
            continues to negatively affect the person, it is often their inability to adopt the
            appropriate coping style for a specific situation or lacking the ability to implement
            cognitive restructuring and a positive re-evaluation for their perceived stressor.
            Re-framing a situation becomes the key.
         </p>
         <p id="d2e301">People will tend to adopt problem-focus coping styles for uncontrollable situations
            whereas they would benefit from adopting an emotion-focus coping style as the situation
            cannot be changed (or unlikely to be under their control). Conversely, they will tend
            to adopt emotion-focus coping styles when in reality they could address the situation
            by acquiring new skills such as for example getting new information, through problem-focus
            coping styles. <a href="#f2">Figure 2</a> below represents what we refer to as the cognitive triangle which aims to explain
            the interrelationship of how our feelings, thinking (thoughts) and actions (behaviour
            responses) can affect each others.

         <p id="d2e313">One of the challenges experienced by individuals on the ASC, is indeed their ability
            to adopt these changes, assess and evaluate distressful situations and appraise what
            can be done as an alternative. Often, they may not necessarily have the ability or
            skills to perform this mechanism of re-appraisal without significant amount of adult
            support, visual and gestural prompting and guidance to remain focused, to attend relevant
            information or filter out irrelevant one. Understanding these mechanisms – behind
            the source of stress – remains the key if we want to ensure that the most appropriate
            level of psychological and educational support is provided.

         <p id="d2e315">In the next section, the paper aims to illustrate some practical examples on how this
            process of understanding different sources of stress can lead to a more proactive
            resolution and adoption of appropriate coping styles rather than relying on reactive
            responses.

               be adopted for any stress management reduction plan/intervention by being aware and
               understanding their limitations and more importantly by recognizing and use their
               strengths. This is the process which would be followed for an elite athlete in order
               to achieve optimal results in competition. You identify their strengths and work on
               their weaknesses with a targeted goal-oriented program. The transaction between the
               individual and their environmental demands related to their performance ought to be
               considered as a starting point, rather than considering the environment as a static
               vessel where the individual has to perform – at all costs. Reducing and mitigating
               stressors means also being able to be tuned in with what the individual with ASC wants
               to achieve and how they are going to get there. Through clear goal-oriented tasks
               and activities this can be achieved by using pathways that are appropriate to the
               individual in terms of skills acquisition, mastery and generalization. There is clear
               evidence that competition is perceived in the context of people’s environment, therefore
               such a construct is equally applicable to an elite athlete as much as a person with
               ASCs.

            <p class="first" id="d2e325">It is important getting to know the client which again remains the most significant
               step to be adopted when addressing these groups of stressors. In the context of organizational
               stressors, this will ensure that, as far as possible, and within the constraints of
               any organization, the client has a voice and can make supported and structured choices
               within the environment where s/he ‘performs’. This can be achieved through the use
               of visual schedules (see <a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>), planning for a change of environment – travel and/or accommodation – which can
               also be provided through the use of technology, iPads, photo and personalized timetables.

            <p id="d2e337">Furthermore, it will be significant to change the environment and organizational structure
               in order to provide the optimal learning environment. By offering opportunities to
               the individual in choosing who they will be working with, by looking at their social
               support and significant others – with who they can build a good-fit and promote positive
               social interaction, the individual will ultimately increase their participation on
               where they want to get to and what they want to achieve.

            <p id="d2e339">In sport, coach and athlete relationship is one of the most significant factors for
               competition and performance success (<a href="#r9">Jowett, 2005</a>). It is about their partnership and overall, this partnership is embedded in the
               dynamic and complex coaching process and provides the means by which coaches’ and
               athletes’ needs are expressed and fulfilled (<a href="#r10">Jowett &amp; Cockerill, 2002</a>). The coach–athlete relationship is recognized as the foundation of coaching and
               a major force in promoting the development of athletes’ <i>physical</i> and <i>psychosocial skills</i> hence the question: why can we not think of individuals on the ASCs as athletes and
               professionals supporting them as coaches and how can we get the best out of this partnership?

            <p class="first" id="d2e358">Getting to know the client – having knowledge of the individual with ASCs current
               personal situation outside the organization – their social support environment, their
               emotional environment, their communication environment (how and when they communicate)
               – can help in the process of understanding what other contributing factors amount
               to the source of stress. This can be achieved through the use of personal pictorial
               diaries, through gathering and sourcing key information about the individual, what
               their present situation is like and importantly what their immediate and long-term
               future is going to be. Who are the significant people in their lives? Carl R. <a href="#r12">Rogers (1967)</a> explained that a helping relationship involves amongst other things, an ability or
               desire to understand the other person’s <i>meaning</i> and <i>feelings</i>, demonstrates an interest without being overly emotionally involved, and a sound
               and growing mutual liking, trust and respect between the two people.

            <p id="d2e369">Emotional self-regulation can be taught through the adoption of an emotional-barometer
               where an individual can be supported in identifying emotional responses to a situation
               and ways to solve it (See <a href="#f4">Figure 4</a>). The adoption of breathing exercises, meditation skills can also be introduced and
               taught.

         <p class="first" id="d2e384">The aim of this paper was to present a better understanding of coping styles and responses
            to stressful situations/events in individuals with ASC. By illustrating current knowledge
            in the sport and performance literature, the paper points out how stressors and stress
            management is conceptualized and aimed at clarifying the notion of a process which
            is fluid rather than a static event/situation in time. Sources of stress can be different
            and perceived differently by each individual. Understanding coping mechanisms and
            styles behind stress management can help us to better support individuals with ASC
            there, where skills, resources and access may be scarce. Recently adapted cognitive
            behavioral therapies (CBTs) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) approaches
            have been used for the benefit of high-functioning individuals with ASC and preliminary
            results show promising outcomes especially with symptoms of depression and anxiety
            (<a href="#r16">Weiss &amp; Lunsky, 2010</a>). Generalisability of CBT has presented a challenge especially for those individuals
            with ASC who may lack communication and theory of mind skills (the ability to understand
            what others are experiencing, feeling and thinking). However, MBSR approaches seem
            to be effective with high functioning adolescents with ASCs through the teaching of
            meditative breathing skills (<a href="#r14">Singh et al., 2011</a>).
         </p>
         <p id="d2e392">By exploring current coping styles in individual with ASC and by reflecting on new
            ways in which level of stress and anxiety can be addressed through acceptance, awareness
            and observation, noticing what is actually going on, rather than providing a reactive
            response to the symptoms (both observable and non-observable) will better equip the
            individual in managing their own stressors. By teaching ways on how to understand
            and address the relationship between our thoughts and feelings and subsequently our
            responses/actions to it (behaviors) will support the individual with ASC to better
            attune to the self and in some ways attune to others. As a result of better understanding
            how individuals with ASC cope with anxiety induced situations and by providing more
            sound ways to self-manage such anxieties, they subsequently will benefit from the
            opportunity perhaps to access a wider range of community-based activities and by bettering
            the quality of their interactions and experiences.
         </p>
         <p id="d2e394">More empirical studies are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of such approaches
            and perhaps further knowledge can be again drawn from other fields of sport performance
            psychology where the mind and body are very much interrelated. The coach-athlete partnership
            model can also be further explored where the quality and type of constructs – commitment,
            complementarity, and closeness – could be explored within the client and support staff
            partnership. How can we optimize the ‘performance’ of individuals with ASCs, how can
            we ensure that self-management remains at the forefront of priorities for professionals
            and staff working with them, how can we continue to provide a meaningful and ultimately
            fulfilling path to their quality of life. These are questions and reflections that
            remain partly unanswered.
